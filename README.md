Intermediate contract to allow donations from DAOs or other contracts to Giveth milestones via its bridge.

The `FundsForwarder` is meant to be a proxy deployed by its factory `FundsForwarderFactory`. The current implementation uses [EIP 1167](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1167.md), a technique to deploy forwarding proxies (not upgradable) at very low gas costs. The `FundsForwarder` incorporates the [Initializable](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/common_Initializable) and [Petrifiable](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/common_Petrifiable) scheme used by [Aragon](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS) to freeze the original logic contract and control proxy initialization. The initialization is done atomically in one transaction by the `FundsForwarderFactory`. The `FundsForwarder` contract also incorporates functionality from the Escapable contract by Jordi Baylina and AdriÃ  Massanet to allow recovery of funds as a last resort if a security issue is uncovered.

## How to use it (front-end reference)

### Create a new funds forwarder

A revelant individual of a specific milestone or campaing should be shown a button "Create donation address" that calls `FundsForwarderFactory.newFundsForwarder(uint64 _giverId, uint64 _receiverId)`

The address of this contract will be constant and determined after deployment, so it should be hardcoded in the code.

**Sample code**

```js
import web3 from "./web3GetterOrSomething";
import fundsForwarderFactoryAbi from "contracts/fundsForwarderFactoryAbi.json";

const fundsForwarderFactoryAddress = "ALREADY_KNOWN";

const fundsForwarderFactory = web3.eth.Contract(
  fundsForwarderFactoryAbi,
  fundsForwarderFactoryAddress
);

async function createDonationAddress() {
  const receipt = await fundsForwarderFactory.methods
    .newFundsForwarder(giverId, receiverId)
    .send();

  const newFundForwarderEvent = receipt.events.find(
    ({ event }) => event === "NewFundForwarder"
  );
  const donationAddress = newFundForwarderEvent.returnValues.fundsForwarder;
  return donationAddress;
}
```

### Send funds to the funds forwarder

Regular ethereum token or ETH transaction

### Forward funds to the bridge

The UI should query the balance of each funds forwarder contract of the milestones that the user is insterested in.

If a sufficient balance of one or multiple tokens is found for a giveth funds forwarder contract, the front end should alert the user and offer a button "Forward to the Bridge" or "Collect donations". This button should trigger the function `FundsForwarder.forwardMultiple(address[] _tokens)`.

**Sample code**

```js
import web3 from "./web3GetterOrSomething";
import fundsForwarderAbi from "contracts/fundsForwarderAbi.json";
import erc20Abi from "contracts/erc20Abi.json";

const whitelistedTokens = [
  "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7",

];

const minimumBalanceToForward = web3.utils.toWei("0.1");

async function forwardToTheBridge(fundsForwarderAddress) {
  const tokensToForward = [];

  for (const tokenAddress of whitelistedTokens) {
    const erc20 = web3.eth.Contract(erc20Abi, tokenAddress);
    const balance = await erc20.methods.balanceOf(fundsForwarderAddress).call();
    if (balance > minimumBalanceToForward) tokensToForward.push(tokenAddress);
  }

  if (!tokensToForward.length) return;

  const fundsForwarder = web3.eth.Contract(
    fundsForwarderAbi,
    fundsForwarderAddress
  );

  await fundsForwarder.methods.forwardMultiple(tokensToForward).send();
}
```

## Gas costs

| Action                                        | Gas cost  | Frequency                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Deploy FundsForwarderFactory (w/ child logic) | 3,654,402 | Once                                               |
| Deploy FundForwarder                          | 117,087   | Once for each applicable milestone                 |
| Forward ETH to bridge                         | 39,297    | Every time each milestone requires the funds       |
| Forward Tokens (DAI) to bridge                | 78,596    | First time each milestone requires the funds       |
| Forward Tokens (DAI) to bridge                | 39,103    | Every other time each milestone requires the funds |
| Forward multiple tokens (ETH, DAI, FAKEERC20) | 80,660    | -                                                  |

Gas costs without proxy are: Deploy FundForwarder +1,317%, Forward ETH to bridge -2%, Forward Tokens to bridge -1%.

## How to deploy

Only one contract has to be deployed (`FundsForwarderFactory`), which will deploy the logic of the child contract and do all the setup actions.

The flattened code of the contract is ready to be copy / pasted to remix and can be found in [flattened_contracts/FundsForwarderFactory.sol](flattened_contracts/FundsForwarderFactory.sol). If the code is re-compiled from source, use solidity version `0.4.24+commit.e67f0147` and enable the optimizer.

The arguments for the constructor are:

| Argument                 | Value                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| \_childImplementation    | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000                                                                              |

**SECURITY NOTE**: The FundsForwarderFactory contract will immediately grant its ownership to the bridge owner. The address deploying the contract will have no special priviledges on the FundsForwarderFactory and FundsForwarders at any time.

**RE-REPLOYMENT NOTE**: If you want to deploy a second FundsForwarderFactory contract and not re-deploy the childImplementation, you must pass its address as a contructor argument, and you should modify the FundsForwarder code from the FundsForwarderFactory to save around ~1,500,000 gas on deployment.
